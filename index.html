### Data Summary

Data from the Scottish Public Health Observatory showing people discharged from psychiatric hospitals in Scotland between 2002 and 2020, presented as a 3-year rolling average, and linked to Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation.

### Map: Psychiatric Patient Hospitalisations in Scotland attributable to deprivation 2017-18 to 2019-2020

```{r map-plotting}
# Plot the data onto a map using the object just created
# Use geom_sf to plot the shapefile and use the breaks specified in previous steps to categorise the council areas and use the correct colour based on the differences between quintiles 1 and 5
# A palette of blues, useful for colour-blindness, is used to colour the areas of the map according to the breaks
# Legend labels have been changed from the breaks values to something easier to interpret
# Similar theme formatting has been applied
